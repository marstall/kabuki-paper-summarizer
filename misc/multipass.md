Intellectual disability is a common feature of Kabuki Syndrome, and management is largely supportive. This has motivated efforts to test targeted, mechanism-based interventions.

## Kabuki syndrome and the problem of “closed” chromatin
Kabuki syndrome is a genetic cause of intellectual disability linked to mutations in **KMT2D** or **KDM6A**, two genes that affect chromatin opening. Chromatin is DNA packaging that can be more open or closed, shaping how easily genes are expressed. KMT2D adds a histone mark associated with open chromatin (H3K4me3), while KDM6A removes a histone mark associated with closed chromatin (H3K27me3). Because Kabuki syndrome is associated with reduced chromatin opening, investigators have tested drugs that shift chromatin toward a more open state, including histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis).

In a Kabuki mouse model (Kmt2d+/βGeo), researchers previously reported craniofacial abnormalities, postnatal growth retardation, reduced adult neurogenesis, and hippocampal memory defects, similar to patients. In the same model, an HDACi called AR-42 previously rescued adult neurogenesis defects and hippocampal memory defects.

## Why diet entered the picture
Because AR-42 is an antineoplastic agent, the study also evaluated a dietary intervention as an alternative route to modulate the same pathway.

A key link between diet and chromatin comes from beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a ketone body produced during ketosis. BHB has HDACi activity and can reach the brain and hippocampus. In a cell-based reporter assay, BHB shows dose-dependent HDAC inhibitor-like activity.

## A ketogenic diet rescues brain-related defects in Kabuki model mice
Researchers tested a 4:1 ketogenic diet (KD) regimen to raise BHB in vivo using a protocol modeled on human treatment. The diet increased BHB levels in vivo, with a stronger BHB rise in Kabuki model mice than in wild-type littermates. Elevation of BHB was also observed in serum and brain tissue of Kabuki model mice in response to the KD. The study links the diet’s benefit to increased BHB, an endogenous HDACi.

After two weeks, the KD rescued hippocampal memory defects and adult neurogenesis deficits in the Kabuki mouse model. In the dentate gyrus granule cell layer, the KD increased neurogenesis markers (EdU+ and DCX+ cells), with partial normalization toward wild-type levels. In behavior, the KD improved Morris water maze probe trial performance in Kabuki model mice, indicating rescue of hippocampal memory defects.

The diet also shifted histone marks in the predicted direction. A KD increased open-chromatin–associated histone marks (H3K4me3 and H3ac) in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer of Kabuki model mice, including normalization of H3ac levels.

## Evidence that BHB is a main driver
Exogenous BHB administration can also rescue the adult neurogenesis defect in Kabuki model mice, supporting BHB as a major driver of the diet’s benefit.

BHB has other biochemical actions, but its benefit profile matched that of HDAC inhibitor treatment, consistent with modulation of histone marks.

## Gene expression: many small shifts, partial normalization
In the hippocampus of Kabuki model mice, gene expression changes are mostly down-regulation, consistent with Kmt2d promoting transcription, but individual gene changes are subtle. KD treatment increased expression of several highly down-regulated hippocampal genes in Kabuki model mice, though it cannot restore Kmt2d itself because the allele is disrupted.

One gene highlighted is **Glp1r**, which is normalized by the KD. Glp1r encodes a protein localized to neuronal synapses, and Glp1r disruption in mice is linked to reversible hippocampal memory defects.

Kabuki-related phenotypes reflect combined effects of many dysregulated genes rather than a single pathway, complicating attempts to map specific symptoms to specific gene changes.

## Metabolism may shape response to ketosis
Beyond the brain, the Kabuki model mice show a metabolic phenotype during ketosis. The KD increases the BHB/acetoacetate ratio in Kabuki model mice, pointing to altered NADH/NAD+ balance during ketosis. The mice also show higher lactate/pyruvate ratios during ketosis, consistent with an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio. This exaggerated BHB/acetoacetate ratio change is not seen in a Rubinstein–Taybi mouse model, indicating that the shift is not reproduced in that comparison.

Changes in NADH/NAD+ could also affect chromatin via sirtuins, which are NAD+-dependent HDACs. The authors propose that, if the exaggerated BHB elevation observed during KD in mice also occurs in Kabuki Syndrome patients, KD therapy would be expected to have stronger effects in that population; this has not been tested.

## What the study claims overall
Therapeutically relevant BHB levels can be achieved with a KD modeled on human protocols. Compared with AR-42, the KD shows genotype-dependent benefit—helping Kabuki model mice but not wild-type—possibly because AR-42 is more potent and less specific or because wild-type mice don’t reach high enough BHB levels.

Overall, the findings link dietary ketosis to measurable changes in neurogenesis, histone marks, and hippocampal memory in a Kabuki syndrome mouse model, and they outline a BHB-centered mechanism relevant to the ketogenic diet’s neurological effects, including in seizure therapy.
