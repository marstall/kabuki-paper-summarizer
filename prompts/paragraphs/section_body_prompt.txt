Summarize this section of an academic paper for a Kabuki-focused audience with general
science knowledge.
- 1-2 short paragraphs, not longer than 3-5 sentences.
- Be sure to provide short inline definitions of science jargon such as:
missense, phenotype, histone, mouse model. Where appropriate, use a more
common word instead (eg use "symptoms" instead of phenotype).
- Don't provide definitions of terms not used in your summary
- Write in a friendly, magazine-style voice suitable for the "Briefs" section
at the beginning of Scientific American: Kabuki Syndrome Edition.
- this will appear inline with the rest of the story.
- End each sentence with a period, including the last sentence.
