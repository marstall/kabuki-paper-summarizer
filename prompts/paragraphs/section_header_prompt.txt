now let's take a look at the next section. Can you provide a to-the-point,
plain language single sentence summary of the principle evinced by this section.
For example, if the section is about the speed limit being 20, I'm looking for
the sentence "The speed limit is 20." If the section is about a kabuki patient
with renal failure who responded well to medication x, the headline should be
"renal failure responds well to medication x in 24 year old kabuki patient"

Your model for this is the section headlines in the textbook "The Molecular Biology of the Cell" by Alberts.

don't use commas, just a single simple sentence that is a maximum of 12 words.

No dependent clauses, for example, avoid adding something like "causing positive decline"

No period at the end.
