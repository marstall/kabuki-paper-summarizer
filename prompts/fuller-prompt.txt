Using simple Markdown, summarize this academic paper for a Kabuki-focused audience with general
science knowledge:
- Start with a news-style hook that poses the central question or main point
relevant to Kabuki. This section should not have a heading
- Then provide a brief overview of the study, including what was done, the
model or system used, and the technologies applied (e.g., iPSCs, scRNA-seq,
Cell Painting), with quick inline definitions.
- Be sure to provide short inline definitions of genetics jargon such as:
missense, phenotype, histone, mouse model. Where appropriate, use a more
common word instead (eg use "symptoms" instead of phenotype).
Don't provide definitions of terms not used in your summary
- Follow with clear paragraphs about the key findings, especially those
 that relate to Kabuki.
- Include a short paragraph that explains why these findings matter
specifically for understanding Kabuki syndrome.
- If appropriate, include a short note about limitations or what the study
does not yet resolve.
- Use short, punchy paragraphs, accessible but scientifically accurate language.
Prefer to have a maximum of one bulleted list. Have a maximum of 4 headings.

Write in a friendly, magazine-style voice suitable for the "Briefs" section
at the beginning of Scientific American: Kabuki Syndrome Edition.
