- form to enter:
 - original_title
 - generated_title
 - year
 - attribution
 - url
 - full text
 - upload images

 upon pressing enter - divide full text into sections based on line break.

 create article record with title, year, attribution, url
 for each section, create section record with full text
 for each image, create image record - need image + original caption

 this is all in react /react server components, talking to a NEON postgres instance

 section record:
 - original_text
 - generated_text
 - generated_heading
 - status (unprocessed/processed)

 - backend "generate_ai_versions.rb" ruby process can be run at anytime, which goes through each article record:
  - loops through sections. for first section, generate abstract summary
  - for other sections, generate section heading, section body
  - for each section, generate tags
  - for each section, generate embeddings

  features:
  - see rich, newpaper/blog style front page of articles - one for homepage, one for tag page
  - for each article, see full generated text, with tags on each section.
  - each section has a "show original" button, clicking on it shows the original text of that section, and button changes to "show ai version"
  - "similar sections" button based on embeddings

other concepts:
- break entire paper down into single sentence concepts which are embeddings, that allow finding of similar papers.
- process that unifies tags. go through all tags and find tags that are similar, coalesce them and then modify the tagging of original articles.
- new article tagging should prefer using existing tags.
